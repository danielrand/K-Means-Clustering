# K-Means-Clustering
C++ K-Means Clustering Algorithm Implementation  

# What does the progam do?
Provided a sample "image" text file consiting of binary values there are k groups, or clusters, of 1's. The first line of the file is the image header containing information about the dimensions and min and max values. The progam will identiy, isolate and label the points from each group, finding the clusters via the k means clustering algorithm. This will be outputted to outFile2. 

# Sample Input
Sample_Input/Kmeans_image_data2.txt

# Sample output:


# How to run

./a.out ../Sample_Input/Kmeans_image_data2.txt 6 ../Sample_Input/outFile1.txt ../Sample_Input/outFile2.txt ../Sample_Input/outFile3.txt
